Detection on various types of objects on top of the tower (e.g.: GPS, Cable, Sign Board, Jumper Labeling and etc)


## Problem Statement: GPS & Weatherproofing Detection
GPS units critical for network synchronization. Weatherproofing cables must be properly installed to prevent signal degradation and equipment failure during monsoons.

## Our Solution 
AI model detects GPS antenna presence and verifies weather-proof cable connections in tower site images. Identifies missing or improperly installed protection.

## Business Impact
• Prevents network timing issues
• Reduces equipment failure significantly
• Eliminates manual site inspections
• Proactive maintenance alerts

## Problem Statement: Blower Usage & Equipment Cleaning
Tower equipment accumulates dirt, dust, and mud affecting performance. Manual verification of cleaning operations is time-consuming and inconsistent across thousands of sites.

## Our Solution
Detects blower presence and usage in maintenance photos. Verifies cleaning activities were performed according to maintenance schedules and protocols.

## Business Impact
• Ensures equipment longevity
• Validates maintenance completion
• Reduces performance degradation
• Automated compliance tracking

## Problem Statement: Safety Signboard Compliance Detection
Government mandates require specific safety signboards (Non-Ionizing EMF warnings) at every tower site. Missing signboards during regulatory inspections result in hefty fines and legal complications.

## Our Solution
Automatically detects presence and legibility of mandatory safety signboards in site photos. Flags non-compliant sites before government inspections.

## Business Impact
• Avoids regulatory penalties
• Complete compliance monitoring
• Saves substantial costs in potential fines
• Instant violation alerts
